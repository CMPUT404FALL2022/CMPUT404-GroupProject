# Project setup

## Setting up a new environment
Before we do anything else we'll create a new virtual environment, using venv. This will make sure our package configuration is kept nicely isolated from any other projects we're working on.
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
## Install Django and Django REST framework into the virtual environment
```
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
```
## Run app
python manage.py runserver
